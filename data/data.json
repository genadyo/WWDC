I’ll make an announcement on how to RSVP for the party as we get closer to WWDC. Once you register for The Loop Bash, your ticket can be stored in your Apple Wallet—just show up and your ticket will be scanned at the door. Having a ticket does not guarantee entry into the party, but we always do our best to get everyone in.\n\nI can’t wait to see you all there!",
